This is a modified scribble theme for Jekyll 3.0, transplant from [scribble](https://github.com/chloerei/scribble).

After Github update the Jekyll from 2.x to 3.0 in 2016/5/1, the default markdown processor is changed to kramdown, the origin scribble theme syntax highlighting doesn't work anymore. so I created a default site by `$jekyll new my-awesome-site` command, just replace the layout and css style by scribble theme, but keep the default synatx highlighting style.
